# MealSync - Personalized Meal Planning Application

MealSync is an advanced meal planning platform designed to generate customized meal plans tailored to individual dietary requirements, fitness objectives, and daily routines. The application leverages several sophisticated algorithms including natural language processing (NLP), linear programming, genetic algorithms, and constraint satisfaction techniques. NLP capabilities enable intelligent interpretation of user preferences and requirements, which directly influences meal suggestions. Through linear programming, the system optimizes meal combinations for maximum nutritional benefit, while the constraint satisfaction system ensures all recommendations strictly comply with users' specified dietary restrictions and preferences.
